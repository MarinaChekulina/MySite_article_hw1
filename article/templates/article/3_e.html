<p>The museum exhibits can offer expanded information sent to your phone when the person is situated near them.</p>
<p>Another commonly-cited use case is when you’re at a shopping mall. Imagine walking along and being notified of nearby
    sales at your favorite stores. Or if it’s really crowded (such as when shopping during Black Friday), Wi-Fi Aware
    could help pinpoint the location of lost friends and family.
    Speaking of crowds, let’s say you’re traveling through the bustling streets of New York City. Wouldn’t it be great
    if your phone alerted you to say that an old friend is sitting on a bench just a few meters behind you? With Wi-Fi
    Aware, the possibilities are limitless.</p>
