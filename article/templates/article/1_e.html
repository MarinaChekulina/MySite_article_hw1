<p align="center">It’s a refined example of the Internet of Things, an idea that describes a network of interconnected
    devices where all the devices are constantly sending information back and forth without any human involvement.

    Here’s how it works: Wi-Fi Aware devices can act as publishers, subscribers, or both. Publisher devices persistently
    broadcast a signal that indicates permission to connect. Subscriber devices persistently search for publishers, and
    when found, will initiate a connection request.

    Wi Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Aware™ is a new(it was launched in January,2015) Wi-Fi Alliance certification program that
    extends Wi-Fi’s capabilities with a
    real-time and energy-efficient discovery mechanism that provides an immediate on-ramp to rich here-and-now
    experiences. Wi-Fi Aware’s ability to continuously discover other devices and services within Wi-Fi range before
    making a connection brings proximity-based service discovery to Wi-Fi CERTIFIED devices. Wi-Fi Aware will make it
    easy to find information and services available in an area that match preferences set by the user – and is optimized
    to work well even in crowded environments. Wi-Fi Aware will be a key enabler of a personalized social, local, and
    mobile experience, enabling users to find video gaming opponents, share media content, and access localized
    information all before establishing a connection.
